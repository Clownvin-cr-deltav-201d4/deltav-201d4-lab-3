      <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
      <p>My name is Calvin Hall. I would describe myself as a junior Java developer.
        I've got about 9 years experience working with Java, since early middleschool.
        I got into programming because of runescape bots. Back during all the botting rage,
        I decided to try and make my own by piecing other mods together into a "frankenstein"
        amalgamation of different code scraps.
        I never really enjoyed web development, as I always thought it was more about making a pretty
        design than solving actual issues.
