        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
        <p>My name is Calvin Hall. I would describe myself as a junior Java developer.
          I've got about 9 years experience working with Java, since early middleschool.
          I got into programming because of runescape bots. Back during all the botting rage,
          I decided to try and make my own by piecing other mods together into a "frankenstein"
          amalgamation of different code scraps.
          I never really enjoyed web development, as I always thought it was more about making a pretty
          design than solving actual issues.

        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <p>I'd like to start this out by saying I'm not EXACTLY sure what to do here. The lab 2 documentation was not very explicit on what
          exactly to put on this webpage, and on asking the instructor, he said I should implement the "user stories" listed on the lab 2 documentation. So here they are...</p>
          <br>As a student, I want to create an About Me page as a demonstration of my skills with HTML.
          <br>As an eventual jobseeker, I want to get practice in creating a portfolio page so that I can make myself appealing to potential employers.
          <br>As an eventual jobseeker, I would like for potential employers to quickly learn a few things about me, such as a short bio, my education, an overview of my job experience, and my goals.
          <br>As a fun-loving human being, I want to give the visitors to my About Me page a guessing game that shows how fun-loving and interesting I am, and maybe include things about myself that would not ordinarily appear in a portfolio page.
          <br>As a developer, I want to use markup to structure my index.html page, so the layout is in the order of assembly I prefer, with effective use of the markup possibilities offered by HTML.
          <br>As a developer, I want to carefully design my scripts, so I can understand how to organize and write my code to achieve my goals in interactivity.
          <br>As a developer, I want to create a simple script for my index.html page using JavaScript, so that I can use the browser to send a response to the user.
          <br>As a developer, I want to receive and use the user's name, so that the program is personalized to their experience.
          <br>As a developer, I want to provide five questions to the user, so that they can guess the answers and get to know me.
          <br>As a developer, I want to notify the user after each question, so they are aware whether they were correct or not in their answers.
          <br>As a developer, I want to be able to debug my code by using well structured console messages.
          <br>As a developer, I want to manage my code through an online version control system, so I have the ability to work with others, manage my revisions, and keep a thorough record of my progress.
